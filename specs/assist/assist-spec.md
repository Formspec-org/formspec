# Formspec Assist Specification v1.0

**Version:** 1.0.0-draft.1
**Date:** 2026-03-27
**Editors:** Formspec Working Group
**Companion to:** Formspec v1.0 — A JSON-Native Declarative Form Standard

---

## Abstract

The Formspec Assist Specification defines a transport-agnostic interoperability
contract for software that helps people complete forms. It standardizes how an
agent, browser extension, accessibility tool, automation system, or chat layer
can discover a live Formspec form, inspect its structure and current state,
retrieve contextual help from References and Ontology sidecars, validate input,
and request mutations in a controlled, user-consented way.

This specification is the filling-side counterpart to the Formspec authoring
tool surface. It does not define form rendering, authoring workflows, or LLM
behavior. Instead it defines the structured protocol that those systems can rely
on: tool names, result envelopes, error codes, context-resolution rules,
profile-matching behavior, transport requirements, and browser-facing discovery
conventions.

Assist is additive. A processor that does not implement this specification
remains fully conformant to Formspec core. An implementation that does support
Assist MUST NOT change core response, validation, calculation, or relevance
semantics.

## Status of This Document

This document is a **draft specification**. It is a companion to Formspec v1.0
and does not modify the core processing model. Implementors are encouraged to
experiment with it and provide feedback, but MUST NOT treat it as a stable
production contract until a 1.0.0 release is published.

## Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14][rfc2119] [RFC 2119]
[RFC 8174] when, and only when, they appear in ALL CAPITALS, as shown here.

JSON syntax and data types are as defined in [RFC 8259]. URI syntax is as
defined in [RFC 3986]. JSON Schema refers to JSON Schema draft-07 unless a
transport binding explicitly states otherwise.

Terms defined in the Formspec v1.0 core specification retain their meanings
throughout this document unless explicitly redefined.

Additional terms:

- **Assist Provider** — a live implementation that exposes the Assist tool
  catalog for one active form.
- **Assist Consumer** — any system that discovers and invokes Assist tools.
- **Passive Provider** — a renderer that emits declarative metadata helpful to
  agents, but does not expose the full tool catalog.
- **Profile** — a user-controlled, reusable store of values keyed primarily by
  ontology concept identity and secondarily by field path.
- **Human-in-the-loop** — an explicit user confirmation step before a mutation
  with user-visible consequences is applied.

## Bottom Line Up Front

- Assist defines a standard tool surface for **form filling**, not form
  authoring.
- The required core covers **introspection, help lookup, mutation, and
  validation** for a live form.
- Context for a field is assembled from **References** and **Ontology**
  sidecars using a deterministic resolution algorithm.
- Cross-form autofill is driven by **ontology concept identity**, not by field
  name heuristics alone.
- The protocol is **transport-agnostic** and can be bound to WebMCP, MCP,
  `postMessage`, HTTP, or in-process calls.
- Assist is **LLM-independent**. Chat experiences are consumers of this spec,
  not part of it.
- Assist is **additive**. It MUST NOT alter core data semantics, validation
  semantics, or the response model.

## 1. Purpose and Scope

Formspec already captures the raw ingredients needed for assisted form
completion:

1. **Form state and validation** via the Formspec engine and core processing
   model.
2. **Contextual knowledge** via References Documents.
3. **Semantic identity** via Ontology Documents and `semanticType`.

This specification defines how those ingredients become interoperable at
runtime.

### 1.1 What This Specification Defines

This specification defines:

1. A **normative tool catalog** for live-form inspection, help, mutation,
   validation, navigation, and profile workflows.
2. A **field-help resolution algorithm** combining References, Ontology,
   registries, and field metadata.
3. A **profile-matching algorithm** for cross-form reuse of user data.
4. **Transport requirements** that any Assist binding MUST satisfy.
5. **Declarative browser annotations** that passive consumers can inspect
   without full tool access.
6. **Discovery conventions** for sidecar documents and browser extensions.

### 1.2 What This Specification Does Not Define

This specification does not define:

1. Form rendering or component behavior.
2. Form authoring or authoring-side MCP tools.
3. LLM prompts, chat UX, or model selection.
4. A mandatory storage engine for user profiles.
5. A single canonical JSON document schema for the protocol as a whole.

> **Design note:** Assist is a live interoperability contract, not a sidecar
> document format. Tool declarations SHOULD use JSON Schema for their input
> shapes, but this specification does not define one top-level schema file
> analogous to `definition.schema.json` or `references.schema.json`.

### 1.3 Relationship to Other Specifications

| Specification | Relationship |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Assist reads and mutates state governed by the core processing model. |
| **References** | Assist uses References Documents as one source of contextual help. |
| **Ontology** | Assist uses Ontology Documents and registry concepts for semantic alignment and profile matching. |
| **Component** | Passive annotations are emitted by renderers but MUST NOT alter component semantics. |
| **Registry** | Registry concept entries participate in the ontology resolution cascade. |
| **Authoring MCP** | Assist is the filling-side analogue, not a replacement or extension of authoring MCP tools. |

### 1.4 Design Principles

1. **LLM-independent.** The protocol MUST stand on structured data alone.
2. **User-controlled mutation.** Providers MUST preserve user agency, especially
   for autofill and bulk actions.
3. **Additive, not invasive.** Assist MUST NOT redefine core semantics.
4. **Transport-neutral.** Tool behavior is normative; transport wiring is not.
5. **Graceful degradation.** Consumers SHOULD still extract useful behavior when
   sidecars or full provider support are absent.

## 2. Conformance Roles

This specification defines three conformance roles.

### 2.1 Assist Provider

An Assist Provider exposes the tool catalog for a live form.

A conformant Assist Provider:

- **MUST** implement every tool in §3.2, §3.3, and §3.4.
- **MUST** follow the field-help resolution algorithm in §5.
- **MUST** preserve the result and error contracts in §4.
- **MUST NOT** write to readonly or non-relevant fields through Assist tools.

### 2.2 Assist Consumer

An Assist Consumer discovers and invokes Assist tools.

A conformant Assist Consumer:

- **MUST** treat the provider as authoritative for live form state.
- **MUST** parse structured tool results rather than scraping human-readable
  text from them.
- **SHOULD** request or surface user confirmation for high-impact mutations.
- **SHOULD** degrade gracefully when optional tool categories are absent.

### 2.3 Passive Provider

A Passive Provider does not expose the full tool catalog, but emits declarative
metadata per §8.

A conformant Passive Provider:

- **MUST** preserve standard accessibility semantics.
- **SHOULD** emit `data-formspec-*` and field-level annotations where possible.
- **MAY** omit profile and tool invocation support entirely.

## 3. Tool Catalog

### 3.1 Naming

All Assist tools use the namespace `formspec.` followed by a category and
action: `formspec.{category}.{action}`.

### 3.2 Required Core Introspection Tools

| Tool | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `formspec.form.describe` | `{}` | `FormDescription` | High-level form metadata and status. |
| `formspec.field.list` | `{ filter?: "all" \| "required" \| "empty" \| "invalid" \| "relevant" }` | `FieldSummary[]` | Default filter is `"relevant"`. |
| `formspec.field.describe` | `{ path: string }` | `FieldDescription` | Includes live state and resolved help. |
| `formspec.field.help` | `{ path: string, audience?: "human" \| "agent" \| "both" }` | `FieldHelp` | Default audience is implementation-defined; providers SHOULD default to `"agent"` for tool consumers. |
| `formspec.form.progress` | `{}` | `FormProgress` | Progress summary across required and total fields. |

### 3.3 Required Core Mutation Tools

| Tool | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `formspec.field.set` | `{ path: string, value: unknown }` | `SetValueResult` | MUST reject writes to readonly or non-relevant fields. |
| `formspec.field.bulkSet` | `{ entries: Array<{ path: string, value: unknown }> }` | `BulkSetResult` | MAY partially succeed; each entry is independent unless a transport defines stronger atomicity. |

### 3.4 Required Core Validation Tools

| Tool | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `formspec.form.validate` | `{ mode?: "continuous" \| "submit" }` | `ValidationReport` | Default mode is `"continuous"`. |
| `formspec.field.validate` | `{ path: string }` | `{ results: ValidationResult[] }` | Field-scoped validation only. |

### 3.5 Optional Profile Tools

| Tool | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `formspec.profile.match` | `{ profileId?: string }` | `{ matches: ProfileMatch[] }` | Suggests reusable values. |
| `formspec.profile.apply` | `{ matches: Array<{ path: string, value: unknown }>, confirm?: boolean }` | `ProfileApplyResult` | `confirm: true` requires human-in-the-loop. |
| `formspec.profile.learn` | `{ profileId?: string }` | `{ savedConcepts: number, savedFields: number }` | Saves concept-bound values and permitted fallbacks. |

### 3.6 Optional Navigation Tools

| Tool | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `formspec.form.pages` | `{}` | `{ pages: PageProgress[] }` | Available when the provider knows page structure. `PageProgress` MUST be computed over the provider's current live field set for each page, including active repeat instances that exist at evaluation time. |
| `formspec.form.nextIncomplete` | `{ scope?: "field" \| "page" }` | `NextIncompleteResult` | Default scope is `"field"`. For `scope: "page"`, the provider MUST select the next page containing an incomplete live field, including incomplete fields within active repeat instances. |

## 4. Common Result, Error, and Data Contracts

### 4.1 Tool Result Envelope

Every Assist tool invocation MUST return the following envelope:

```typescript
interface ToolResult {
  content: Array<{ type: "text"; text: string }>;
  isError?: boolean;
}
```

The `text` field MUST contain a JSON-stringified payload representing the
tool-specific result object or error object. Consumers MUST parse this payload
before using it.

### 4.2 Error Contract

Error responses set `isError: true` and JSON-stringify a `ToolError` object:

```typescript
interface ToolError {
  code:
    | "NOT_FOUND"
    | "INVALID_PATH"
    | "INVALID_VALUE"
    | "NOT_RELEVANT"
    | "READONLY"
    | "UNSUPPORTED"
    | "ENGINE_ERROR";
  message: string;
  path?: string;
}
```

Providers MAY define additional `x-`-prefixed error codes. Consumers MUST treat
unknown non-`x-` codes as generic failures.

### 4.3 Mutation Rules

For every mutation tool:

1. A provider **MUST** validate that the path resolves to a writable field.
2. A provider **MUST NOT** silently write to a readonly field.
3. A provider **MUST NOT** silently write to a non-relevant field.
4. A provider **MUST NOT** suppress core validation triggered by the write.
5. A provider **SHOULD** support human-in-the-loop confirmation for bulk or
   profile-driven writes.

### 4.4 Common Data Shapes

```typescript
interface FormDescription {
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  url?: string;
  version?: string;
  fieldCount: number;
  pageCount?: number;
  status?: string;
}

interface FieldSummary {
  path: string;
  label: string;
  dataType: string;
  required: boolean;
  relevant: boolean;
  readonly: boolean;
  filled: boolean;
  valid: boolean;
}

interface FormProgress {
  total: number;
  filled: number;
  valid: number;
  required: number;
  requiredFilled: number;
  complete: boolean;
  pages?: PageProgress[];
}

interface PageProgress {
  id: string;
  title?: string;
  fieldCount: number;
  filledCount: number;
  complete: boolean;
}

interface FieldDescription {
  path: string;
  label: string;
  hint?: string;
  dataType: string;
  widget?: string;
  value: unknown;
  required: boolean;
  relevant: boolean;
  readonly: boolean;
  valid: boolean;
  validation: ValidationResult[];
  options?: Array<{ value: string; label: string }>;
  calculated?: boolean;
  expression?: string;
  repeatIndex?: number;
  repeatCount?: number;
  minRepeat?: number;
  maxRepeat?: number;
  help: FieldHelp;
}

interface SetValueResult {
  accepted: boolean;
  value: unknown;
  validation: ValidationResult[];
}

interface BulkSetResult {
  results: Array<{
    path: string;
    accepted: boolean;
    validation: ValidationResult[];
    error?: ToolError;
  }>;
  summary: { accepted: number; rejected: number; errors: number };
}

interface ProfileApplyResult {
  filled: Array<{ path: string; value: unknown }>;
  skipped: Array<{ path: string; reason: string }>;
  validation?: ValidationReport;
}

interface NextIncompleteResult {
  path?: string;
  pageId?: string;
  label: string;
  reason: "empty" | "invalid" | "required";
}
```

`ValidationResult` and `ValidationReport` retain their meanings from the core
Formspec specification and related schemas.

For providers that expose page-scoped progress or navigation, `PageProgress`
and page-scoped `NextIncompleteResult` are computed over the provider's
current live, instance-expanded field set for each page. Page-level results
identify the logical page, not an individual repeat instance. Providers MAY
surface repeat-specific detail through field-scoped tools such as
`formspec.field.describe`.

## 5. Field Help and Context Resolution

### 5.1 `FieldHelp`

`FieldHelp` is the structured grounding object returned by
`formspec.field.help` and embedded in `FieldDescription`.

```typescript
interface FieldHelp {
  path: string;
  label: string;
  references: Partial<Record<ReferenceType, ReferenceEntry[]>>;
  concept?: ConceptBinding;
  equivalents?: ConceptEquivalent[];
  summary?: string;
  commonMistakes?: string[];
}

type ReferenceType =
  | "documentation" | "example" | "regulation" | "policy" | "glossary"
  | "schema" | "vector-store" | "knowledge-base" | "retrieval"
  | "tool" | "api" | "context";

interface ReferenceEntry {
  title: string;
  uri?: string;
  content?: string | object;
  excerpt?: string;
  rel?: string;
  priority?: "primary" | "supplementary" | "background";
}

interface ConceptBinding {
  concept: string;
  system?: string;
  code?: string;
  display?: string;
}

interface ConceptEquivalent {
  concept?: string;
  system?: string;
  code?: string;
  display?: string;
  type?: "exact" | "close" | "broader" | "narrower" | "related";
}
```

### 5.2 References Resolution

To resolve `FieldHelp.references`, a conformant provider MUST:

1. Load every active References Document targeting the live Definition.
2. Determine the field path and its explicit ancestor paths by walking the item
   tree.
3. Collect references whose `target` matches:
   - the exact field path,
   - any explicit ancestor path selected during that walk, and
   - `"#"` for form-level context.
4. **MUST NOT** treat references as implicitly inherited. Any ancestor context
   included in `FieldHelp` is included because the provider explicitly walked
   ancestor targets, not because the References specification defines
   inheritance.
5. Filter by `audience`:
   - `"agent"` consumers receive `agent` and `both`,
   - `"human"` consumers receive `human` and `both`,
   - `"both"` consumers receive all entries.
6. Resolve any document-local `$ref` bindings before grouping.
7. Group entries by `type`.
8. Sort entries within a type by effective priority:
   `primary` before `supplementary` before `background`, preserving document
   order within a tier.

### 5.3 Ontology Resolution Cascade

Concept identity for a field may come from up to three sources. Providers MUST
resolve them in the following order:

1. **Ontology Document binding** — a concept binding for the field's full path
   in an active Ontology Document.
2. **Registry concept entry** — a loaded registry entry whose `name` matches
   the field's `semanticType`.
3. **`semanticType` literal** — the raw `semanticType` string treated as a
   literal semantic annotation.

When processing `equivalents`, an absent relationship type MUST be treated as
`"exact"`.

### 5.4 Synthesized Fields

`summary` and `commonMistakes` are OPTIONAL synthesized outputs. Providers MAY
leave them empty. If present, they MUST be treated as advisory material and
MUST NOT override the authoritative meaning of References or Ontology bindings.

## 6. Profile Matching

### 6.1 Profile Structure

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  created: string;
  updated: string;
  concepts: Record<string, ProfileEntry>;
  fields: Record<string, ProfileEntry>;
}

interface ProfileEntry {
  value: unknown;
  confidence: number;
  source: ProfileEntrySource;
  lastUsed: string;
  verified: boolean;
}

type ProfileEntrySource =
  | { type: "form-fill"; formUrl: string; fieldPath: string; timestamp: string }
  | { type: "manual"; timestamp: string }
  | { type: "import"; source: string; timestamp: string }
  | { type: "extension"; extensionId: string; timestamp: string };

interface ProfileMatch {
  path: string;
  concept?: string;
  value: unknown;
  confidence: number;
  relationship?: "exact" | "close" | "broader" | "narrower" | "related" | "field-key";
  source: ProfileEntrySource;
}
```

### 6.2 Matching Algorithm

For each writable field considered for autofill, a conformant provider MUST:

1. Resolve the field's concept identity using §5.3.
2. Check `profile.concepts[conceptUri]` for an exact concept match.
3. If no exact match exists, evaluate concept equivalents using these
   RECOMMENDED confidence levels:
   - `exact` or absent type: `0.95`
   - `close`: `0.80`
   - `broader` or `narrower`: `0.60`
   - `related`: `0.40`
4. If no concept-based match exists, MAY fall back to `profile.fields[path]`
   with relationship `"field-key"` and low confidence.
5. SHOULD discard matches below an implementation-defined threshold. `0.50` is
   RECOMMENDED.

### 6.3 Learning Rules

When implementing `formspec.profile.learn`, a provider:

- **SHOULD** store values under concept identity when available.
- **MAY** store field-path fallbacks for stable, non-concept-bound fields.
- **MUST NOT** transmit profile data off-device or off-origin without explicit
  user consent.

## 7. Transport Bindings

### 7.1 Transport-Neutral Requirements

Any conformant Assist transport MUST provide:

1. **Tool discovery** — the consumer can enumerate available tools together
   with descriptions and JSON input schemas.
2. **Tool invocation** — the consumer can invoke a tool by name with JSON input
   and receive the §4 envelope.
3. **Error preservation** — transport adapters MUST preserve `ToolError`
   semantics.
4. **Human-in-the-loop support** — providers can pause and obtain user
   confirmation before a requested mutation proceeds.

### 7.2 WebMCP Binding

For browser-native environments, Assist tools SHOULD be exposed through
`navigator.modelContext`.

A conformant WebMCP binding:

- **SHOULD** register tools individually rather than through bulk replacement.
- **SHOULD** use `requestUserInteraction()` or an equivalent browser-mediated
  confirmation path for `confirm: true` mutations.
- **MAY** install a polyfill when native WebMCP is unavailable.

### 7.3 MCP Binding

For server-mediated agents, Assist tools MAY be exposed as MCP tools.

A conformant MCP binding:

- **MUST** preserve the Assist tool names and result envelopes.
- **SHOULD** map human-in-the-loop requests to explicit MCP user prompts.

### 7.4 Browser Messaging Binding

Browser extensions and page scripts MAY use a `postMessage`-style binding.

A conformant browser messaging binding SHOULD:

- announce available tools through a DOM event or equivalent discovery signal,
- correlate requests and responses with stable call identifiers,
- isolate privileged extension APIs from injected page code.

### 7.5 HTTP Binding

Remote agents MAY use an HTTP transport.

A conformant HTTP binding SHOULD expose:

- `GET /formspec/tools` for discovery, and
- `POST /formspec/tools/{name}` for invocation.

HTTP is a binding detail only. The normative contract remains the Assist tool
surface and result envelope.

## 8. Declarative Browser Annotations

Renderers SHOULD expose passive metadata that lets consumers identify and
partially understand a form even when no Assist Provider is active.

### 8.1 Form Container Annotations

The form container SHOULD expose:

- `data-formspec-form`
- `data-formspec-title`
- `data-formspec-url`
- `data-formspec-version`

### 8.2 Field-Level Annotations

Where the platform allows, focusable field elements SHOULD expose:

- `toolparamdescription` — concise machine-readable field context,
- `autocomplete` — best-effort HTML autocomplete token,
- standard accessibility metadata such as visible labels, `aria-describedby`,
  and other native semantics.

Providers and renderers **MUST NOT** degrade accessibility to add Assist
annotations.

### 8.3 Ontology-to-Autocomplete Mapping

Renderers SHOULD map well-known concept URIs to HTML `autocomplete` tokens when
there is a reasonable one-to-one correspondence.

| Concept URI | `autocomplete` |
|---|---|
| `https://schema.org/givenName` | `given-name` |
| `https://schema.org/familyName` | `family-name` |
| `https://schema.org/email` | `email` |
| `https://schema.org/telephone` | `tel` |
| `https://schema.org/streetAddress` | `street-address` |
| `https://schema.org/addressLocality` | `address-level2` |
| `https://schema.org/addressRegion` | `address-level1` |
| `https://schema.org/postalCode` | `postal-code` |
| `https://schema.org/addressCountry` | `country` |
| `https://schema.org/birthDate` | `bday` |

This mapping is advisory. Unknown concepts MUST NOT cause an error.

## 9. Sidecar Discovery

Assist Providers and extension consumers often need References and Ontology
sidecars for a form encountered in the wild.

Consumers SHOULD attempt discovery in this order:

1. **Active provider first.** If a live Assist Provider exists, use its tools
   rather than independently reloading sidecars.
2. **HTML link relations.** Pages SHOULD publish sidecars with:
   - `<link rel="formspec-references" href="...">`
   - `<link rel="formspec-ontology" href="...">`
   - `<link rel="formspec-registry" href="...">`
3. **Definition metadata.** A definition MAY publish sidecar URLs in a future
   `sidecars` metadata object.
4. **Well-known sibling paths.** Consumers MAY try heuristic sibling paths such
   as `references.json` and `ontology.json`.

Sidecars are immutable for a given `(definitionUrl, definitionVersion)` pair.
Consumers SHOULD cache using that tuple as the primary key.

Missing sidecars MUST degrade gracefully:

- without References, help contains less context;
- without Ontology, profile matching falls back to weak heuristics;
- without both, core introspection, mutation, and validation still work.

## 10. Extension Integration

Browser extensions are a primary Assist consumer. They SHOULD support three
operating modes.

### 10.1 Mode 1: Active Assist Provider

The page already exposes a conformant Assist Provider.

The extension:

- discovers tools through the provider,
- invokes the full tool catalog,
- treats provider-returned help and validation as authoritative.

### 10.2 Mode 2: Formspec Form Without Assist

The page renders a Formspec form but does not expose Assist.

The extension:

- detects the live form and engine through public host APIs,
- MAY bootstrap an in-page Assist Provider,
- SHOULD discover and cache sidecars using §9.

### 10.3 Mode 3: Plain HTML Form

The page contains no Formspec form.

The extension MAY fall back to heuristic field detection using:

- label associations,
- `name`, `id`, and `placeholder`,
- `aria-label`,
- `autocomplete` tokens.

Mode 3 is explicitly degraded and non-authoritative. Consumers MUST treat its
profile matches as advisory.

## 11. Security and Privacy Considerations

Assist implementations handle sensitive live form data. A conformant provider:

1. **MUST** treat all tool input as untrusted.
2. **MUST** validate paths and values before acting on them.
3. **MUST NOT** bypass readonly or relevance protections.
4. **MUST NOT** block persistence solely because validation findings exist,
   unless the underlying host policy already requires that behavior outside
   Assist.
5. **MUST NOT** transmit profile data without explicit user consent.
6. **SHOULD** encrypt profile storage at rest where the platform allows.
7. **SHOULD** keep privileged browser-extension capabilities separated from any
   page-context bootstrap code.

## 12. Conformance Summary

### 12.1 Provider Requirements

A conformant Assist Provider:

- **MUST** implement the required core tools.
- **MUST** return results using the envelope in §4.1.
- **MUST** implement field-help resolution per §5.
- **MUST** preserve core processing semantics.
- **MUST** support at least one discovery and invocation transport.

### 12.2 Consumer Requirements

A conformant Assist Consumer:

- **MUST** parse structured result payloads.
- **MUST** respect provider errors and unsupported-tool conditions.
- **SHOULD** use provider-exposed help and validation rather than substituting
  scraped UI state when provider access exists.
- **SHOULD** surface or request confirmation for high-impact writes.

### 12.3 Passive Provider Requirements

A conformant Passive Provider:

- **MUST** preserve accessibility and native semantics.
- **SHOULD** emit stable `data-formspec-*` metadata.
- **MAY** omit the active tool surface entirely.
