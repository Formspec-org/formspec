/**
 * A single structured validation finding produced by constraint evaluation during the Revalidate phase (§2.4 Phase 3). Every failed constraint — whether from a Bind 'constraint' expression, a Bind 'required' check, a dataType type check, a repeatable group cardinality violation, a named Validation Shape, or an external system injection — produces exactly one ValidationResult entry. Results are structured JSON objects carrying severity, a resolved instance path, a human-readable message, and machine-readable codes — never boolean pass/fail flags. The absence of a result for a given path means all constraints on that path passed. The six constraintKind values partition results into categories that map 1:1 to the five built-in constraint mechanisms plus external injection. Results from all sources (bind, shape, external) participate equally in conformance determination: any error-severity result blocks completion regardless of source.

This unambiguously identifies the specific data node that failed, even within deeply nested repeatable groups. For root-level fields, the path is just the field key.

   * - 'cardinality': A repeatable group violates its minRepeat or maxRepeat bounds. Standard codes: MIN_REPEAT, MAX_REPEAT.
   * - 'constraint': A Bind 'constraint' expression evaluated to false (e.g., '$ > 0' on a negative value). Standard code: CONSTRAINT_FAILED.
   * - 'shape': A named Validation Shape's constraint or composition evaluated to invalid. Standard code: SHAPE_FAILED. The shapeId property identifies which Shape.
